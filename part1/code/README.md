# a very brief intro to rust - code example

This directory contains a small rust binary project with the "final stage" of
the code examples from the presentation. 

This code is most useful for looking at as a refresh for how to use the syntax
that was introduced, but it is also runnable.

To run the code:

```
cargo run
```
